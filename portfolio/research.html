        <h3>Theory Probe: Genderlect Styles</h3>
        <p>Communication is one of the most commonly used buzz words when it comes to relationships, especially romantic ones, those in which a man and a woman come together in an attempt to merge their lives together into one. Many seasoned couples advise the value of communication in any dating relationship or marriage. What many fail to realize, however, is the fact that this emphasis on communication implies the merging of two cultures, regardless of each individual’s religious, ethnic, or socioeconomic background. That is right – a man and a woman who share the same religion, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status still have a cultural barrier to overcome when it comes to communicating with one another. Communication among males and females occurs between more than one culture, yet many do not acknowledge this as a cross-cultural encounter.</p>
